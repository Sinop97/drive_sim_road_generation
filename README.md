# Road generation to use in a simulation for semantic segmentation
## General

This repository is part of a research project conducted at Esslingen University of Applied Sciences from March 2020 to March 2022 and is based on a fork of the [drive_sim_road_generation](https://github.com/tum-phoenix/drive_sim_road_generation) project from [TUM](https://github.com/tum-phoenix). The original repository was extended for our use case and implements new different objects in the Road Generator. The roads generated by the Road Generator were imported to the Gazebo simulation environment to create synthetic image data to train a semantic segmentation network.

For more details, please refer to our paper: ["Semantic Segmentation for Autonomous Driving:Model Evaluation, Dataset Generation, PerspectiveComparison, and Real-Time Capability"](https://arxiv.org/abs/2207.12939)

## Installation

First: Install **Python 3** and **Gazebo 8**.

http://gazebosim.org/tutorials?tut=install_ubuntu&cat=install

```sh
sudo apt-get install python3 gazebo8 libgazebo8-dev

pip install -r requirements.txt
```

Compile the keyframe plugin for gazebo:

```
cd keyframe_plugin
mkdir build
cd build
cmake ../
make

export GAZEBO_PLUGIN_PATH=`pwd`:$GAZEBO_PLUGIN_PATH
```

Additionally, install the font located in the commonroad/renderer/fonts subfolder, which is needed to draw speed limit numbers.

## Usage
### Generating the road
Generate a scenario in CommonRoad XML from Template XML:
```
./road-generator.py presets/driving.xml --add_color
```
Arguments:

--add_color or -ac: color the world to create labels in the next step (optional)

### Rendering the road
Render CommonRoad XML for Gazbeo:
```
./gazebo-renderer.py driving-scenario.xml -o world -d 40 --add_color --concatenate_tiles
```
Arguments:

--distance or -d: y-distance to world's origin  

--add_color or -ac: color the world to create labels in the next step (optional)

--concatenate_tiles or -ct: concatenate the tiles to close the gaps between the tiles (optional)


Road generation and rendering can also be done in a single step:
```
./road-generator.py presets/driving.xml | ./gazebo-renderer.py -o world
```

View in Gazbeo:
(Make sure the plugin's build folder is set as environment variable `GAZEBO_PLUGIN_PATH`)
```
cd world
gazebo world.sdf
```

### Merging the worlds
Merge the raw world with the colored world:

```
./world-merger.py world
```
